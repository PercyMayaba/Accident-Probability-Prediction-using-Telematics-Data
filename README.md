# Accident-Probability-Prediction-using-Telematics-Data
This project demonstrates how machine learning can predict accident probabilities using synthetic telematics data. The solution combines traditional ML models with deep learning (LSTM) to analyze time-series driving behavior data for insurance risk assessment.
